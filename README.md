# Twitter Prime Bots

This is an experiment to use [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) to create simple Twitter bot.

This script is powering two Twitter bots [Alice Prime](https://twitter.com/AlicePrimes) and [Bob Prime](https://twitter.com/BobPrimes) which are trying to write higher prime number than the other account.

They are linking to [Prime Numbers](https://prime-numbers.info) for some additional information.

If you have any suggestions, please, send me PR.
